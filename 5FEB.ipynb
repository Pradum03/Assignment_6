    "A class defines a set of attributes and methods that are common to all objects created from that class. Attributes are the characteristics of an object, while methods are the actions that an object can perform. An object is created by instantiating a class, which means that a specific instance of the class is created in memory, with its own unique set of attribute values.\n"

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of binding data and the methods that operate on that data in a single unit called a class. The purpose of encapsulation is to protect the data from unwanted access and modification by keeping it hidden from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another class. It allows the creation of a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the user. It is the process of identifying the essential features of an object and ignoring the rest. Abstraction helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency."
